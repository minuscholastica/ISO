# Introduction

Obtaining the ISO 13485 certification is a crucial step for companies aiming to enter the healthcare market with software-based medical devices. This international standard ensures that the processes involved in the design, development, production, installation, and servicing of medical devices meet stringent quality and safety requirements.

ISO 13485 is specifically tailored for organizations operating in the medical device industry, encompassing various aspects of quality management systems (QMS). It serves as a globally recognized benchmark, demonstrating a company's commitment to maintaining robust and consistent processes throughout the product lifecycle.

For startups and software companies venturing into the healthcare domain, obtaining ISO 13485 certification can provide several benefits:

- **Market Access**: Many healthcare organizations and regulatory bodies mandate ISO 13485 certification as a prerequisite for procuring or approving medical devices. Meeting this requirement opens up opportunities for market entry and facilitates easier navigation through regulatory processes.

- **Competitive Advantage**: By demonstrating compliance with internationally recognized quality standards, companies can differentiate themselves from competitors and instill confidence in their products among potential customers and partners.

- **Risk Mitigation**: The ISO 13485 framework emphasizes risk management, ensuring that potential risks associated with medical devices are identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the product lifecycle. This proactive approach helps organizations address safety concerns and minimize potential issues before they arise.

- **Continuous Improvement**: The certification process encourages organizations to establish a culture of continuous improvement, fostering a systematic approach to identifying and addressing quality issues, which can lead to enhanced product reliability and customer satisfaction.
